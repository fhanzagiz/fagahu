		<p><strong>Farmers Daughter Quilt Pattern</strong>. This traditionally pieced 60 x 74 quilt uses blocks such as the Farmers Daughter Hole in the Barn Door and Corn Beans to accent the meaningful word sections. My mission is to be a happy distraction. It is a five patch quilt block so described as it is designed on a 5 x 5 grid but I choose to construct it as an uneven nine patch because I like to work in chunks rather than in rows. On the back side of each square draw a diagonal line corner-to-corner ONE 1 time.</p>
